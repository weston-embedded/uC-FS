*                                      NAND DRIVER CONFIGURATION
*
* Note(s) : (1) FS_NAND_CFG_MAX_CTRLR_IMPL determines the maximum number of registered NAND controller
*               implementations. Each controller that will be used needs to be registered. Registering
*               a controller implementation will invoke its 'Init()' function.

*           (2) FS_NAND_CFG_AUTO_SYNC_EN determines if, for each operation on the device (i.e. each call
*               to the device's API), the metadata should be synchronized. Synchronizing at the end of
*               each operation is safer; it ensures the device can be remounted and appear exactly as it
*               should. Disabling automatic synchronization will result in a large write speed increase,
*               as the metadata won't be committed automatically, unless done in the application. If a
*               power down occurs between a device operation and a sync operation, the device will appear
*               as it was in a prior state when remounted. Device synchronization can be forced with a
*               call to FSDev_Sync().
*
*               Note that using large write buffers will reduce the metadata synchronization performance
*               hit as fewer calls to the device API will be needed.
*
*           (3) FS_NAND_CFG_UPDATE_BLK_META_CACHE_EN determines if, for each update block, the
*               metadata will be cached. Enabling this will allow searching for a specific updated sector
*               through data in RAM instead of accessing the device, which would require additional read
*               page operations.
*
*               More RAM will be consumed if this option is enabled, but write/read speed will be improved.
*
*               RAM usage = (<Nbr update blks> x (log2(<Max associativity>) + log2(<Nbr secs per blk>)) /
*                            8) octets (rounded up).
*
*           (4) FS_NAND_CFG_DIRTY_MAP_CACHE_EN determines if the dirty blocks map will be cached. With
*               this feature enabled, a copy of the dirty blocks map on the device is cached. It is
*               possible then to determine if the state "dirty" of a block is commited on the device
*               without the need to actually read the device.
*
*               With this feature enabled, overall write and read speed should be improved. Also,
*               robustness will be improved for specific cases. However, more RAM will be consumed.
*
*               RAM usage = (<Nbr of blks on device> / 8) octets (rounded up).
*
*           (5) FS_NAND_CFG_UPDATE_BLK_TBL_SUBSET_SIZE controls the size of the subsets of sectors pointed
*               by each entry of the update block tables. The value must be a power of 2 (or 0).
*
*               If, for example, the value is 4, each time a specific updated sector is requested, the
*               NAND translation layer must find the sector from a group of 4 sectors. Thus, if the cache
*               is disabled, 4 sectors must be read from the device. Otherwise, the 4 entries will be
*               searched from in the cache. If the value is set to 0, the table will be disabled
*               completely, meaning that all sectors of the block might have to be be read before the
*               specified sector is found. If the value is 1, the table completely specifies the location
*               of the sector, and thus no search must be performed. In that case, enabling the update
*               blocks metadata cache will yield no performance benefit.
*
*               RAM usage = (<Nbr update blks> x (log2(Nbr secs per blk>) - log2(<Subset size>) x
*                            <Max associativity> / 8) octets (rounded up).
*
*           (6) FS_NAND_CFG_RSVD_AVAIL_BLK_CNT indicates the number of blocks in the available blocks
*               table that are reserved for metadata block folding. Since this operation is critical
*               and must be done before adding blocks to the available blocks table, the driver needs
*               enough reserved blocks to make sure at least one of them is not bad so that the metadata
*               can be folded successfully. When set to 3, probability for the metadata folding operation
*               to fail is really low. This value should be sufficient for most applications.
*
*           (7) FS_NAND_CFG_MAX_RD_RETRIES indicates the maximum number of retries performed when a read
*               operation fails. It is recommended by most manufacturers to retry reading a page if it
*               fails, as successive read operations might be successful. This number should be at least
*               set to 2 for smooth  operation, but might be set higher to improve reliability.
*
*           (8) FS_NAND_CFG_MAX_SUB_PCT indicates the maximum number of update blocks that can be
*               sequential update blocks (SUB). This value is set as a percentage of the total number
*               of update blocks.
